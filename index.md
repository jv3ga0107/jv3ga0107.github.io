## CPSC 120

* Lab 3 
    I really enjoyed both parts of lab 3. Part-1 required us to use a function to then create a code that will give the unit price per square inch of  pizza based on price and size. Part-2 was quite difficult but was also interesting to see how the Julian Day function was necessary to get the difference between dates.

* Lab 4
    Lab 4 was another one of my favorite labs. Using conversion equations to get the different measurements of milliliters to other units of measurement. Coding the hi lo game was also really enjoyable. 

* Lab 9
    Lab 9 part was my third favorite lab. Coding the Olympic Judge program was enjoyable as well. This time we used double integers to be able to show decimal numbers.
